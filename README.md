![Runtime](https://github.com/wickwirew/Runtime/blob/master/Resources/Runtime.png)

Runtime is a Swift library to give you more runtime abilities, including getting type metadata, setting properties via reflection, and type construction for native swift objects.

## TypeInfo
`TypeInfo` exposes metadata about native Swift structs, protocols, classes, tuples and enums. It captures the properties, generic types, inheritance levels, and more.
### Example
Lets say you have a User struct:
```swift
struct User {
  let id: Int
  let username: String
  let email: String
}
```
To get the `TypeInfo` of `User`, all that you have to do is:
```swift
let info = try typeInfo(of: User.self)
```

## Property Info
Within the `TypeInfo` object, it contains a list of `PropertyInfo` which represents all properties for the type. `PropertyInfo` exposes the name and type of the property. It also allows the getting and setting of a value on an object.
### Example
Using the same `Person` object as before first we get the `TypeInfo` and the property we want.
```swift
let info = try typeInfo(of: User.self)
let property = try info.property(named: "username")
var user = User(id: 1, username: "example", email: "example@example.com")
```
To get a value:
```swift
let username = try property.get(from: user)
```
To set a value:
```swift
try property.set(value: "newUsername", on: &user)
```
It's that easy! ðŸŽ‰

## Factory
Runtime also supports building an object from it's `Type`. Both structs and classes are supported.

To build a `User` object:
```swift
let user = try createInstance(type: User.self)
```

## Function Info
`FunctionInfo` exposes metadata about functions. Including number of arguments, argument types, return types, and whether it can throw an error.
### Example
```swift
func doSomething(a: Int, b: Bool) throws -> String { 
  return "" 
}

let info = functionInfo(of: doSomething)
```

## FAQ
Q: When getting and setting a value does it work typeless? (i.e. object casted as `Any`)

A: Yes! The whole library was designed with working typeless in mind.

Q: When creating a new instance of a class is it still protected by ARC?

A: Yes! The retain counts are set properly so ARC can do its job. 

## Installation
Runtime is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'Runtime'
```

## Learn
Want to know how it works? 
Swift stores metadata about every type, however it is not exposed via the stdlib. Runtime opens this up. How the metadata is laid out and aquired is explained in [Type Metadata](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/ABI/TypeMetadata.rst) from the [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift) repo.
