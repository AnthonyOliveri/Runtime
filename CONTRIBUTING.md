# Contributing
Anyone is welcome to contribute and is encouraged to do so. Responses to some pull requests and issues may take a day or two so please be patient. Please keep changes related to adding new features, and bug fixes. Please refain from submitting only formatting, whitespace changes. Any pull request primarily consisting of these kinds of changes will closed and not merged. I would prefer no changes to project settings and configuration. These changes are very hard to understand in a pull request. If it is desired to change the configuration please open an issue. All pull requests should be made to the `develop` branch.
